# PGA Score Predictor

## Overview:
The motivation behind this project is to accurately predict the scores of each of the 4 rounds for a certain player in a specified tournament.
Currently, the project only considers major tournaments, such as the British Open, the U.S. Open, the Masters, the PGA Championship, and the Players Championship from 2018-2023.
Eventually, the goal is to create a web app that can interface with the model to make it easy for users to interact with it.

## Project Structure:
### Data
This folder houses all the files responsible for aggregating, cleaning, and storing the data necessary to train the model.
The data pipeline was created to aggregate the data from three main sources. 
First, PGATour.com provides the player statistics a the tournament level. Examples include the number of putts in a round, the percentages of greens hit in reguation, and driving distnace.
Second, espn.com provides information on player scores for each tournament. 
Third, the Open-Meteo API provides current and historical weather information for a desired location at a desired time.
These three sources create a dataset that provides detailed information on each round of desired tournaments.
The SQLite database is used to house the clean dataset. This is important because it allows for data manipulation in SQL for when data is being analyzed and then modeled.

### Model Development
This folder contains all of analysis around feature engineering, determining feature importance, model development, and model selection. 
Eventually, the final models will be saved and put into production.

### Project Planning:
This folder holds all the documents that are used to keep the project organized. This includes the plan for what data to use, the steps from idea conception to deployment. 
Also, there is a paper that was used to develop domain knowledge on previous modeling techniques on golf problems.
